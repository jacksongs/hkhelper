    "====\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook makes analysis of monthly digest of statistics from Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) pulls the statistics from the 11 monthly CSVs, from all available monthly releases, into one dataset\n",
    "    b) works out which statistics have a monthly frequency\n",
    "    c) collects all the available monthly CSV datasets to make longer monthly analysis possible\n",
    "    d) it grabs the latest edition to check if its figures match previous editions\n",
    "    c) instantly shows the largest movements for the current month\n",
    "    \n",
    "Caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *it ignores figures that aren't monthly and datasets with percentages\n",
    "    *statistics codes deeper than \"class1\" are excluded\n",
    "    *statistics with a date range are also excluded\n",
    "    *some datasets like imports from Vietnam and Philippines have no 2020 data\n",
